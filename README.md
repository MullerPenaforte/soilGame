# SoilGame

>Status: Complete!
### My first game (from my first semester in college) using SOIL and SDL C++

## Technologies used: 
  * C++
  * SOIL
  * SDL

## How to run the application:
  * First, [download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/OldFiles/) and install the compiler.

  * Then, type the C/C++ program and save it.

  * Then, open the command line and change directory to the particular one where the source file is stored, using cd like so:
  cd C:\Documents and Settings\...
  
  * Then, to compile, type in the command prompt:
  gcc sourcefile_name.c -o outputfile.exe
  
  * Finally, to run the code, type:
  outputfile.exe
